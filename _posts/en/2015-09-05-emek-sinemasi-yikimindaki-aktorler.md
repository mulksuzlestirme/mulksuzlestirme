description:    "The iconic Emek movie theatre, built in 1924, was the epicenter of Taksim’s cultural scene. Despite many protests, the historic venue - a public property - was demolished in 2013 by Kamer construction company owned by Turkmall Holding to make way for a shopping and entertainment complex called ‘Grand Pera’. In this map you can trace other investments of Turkmall Holding - mostly malls."
