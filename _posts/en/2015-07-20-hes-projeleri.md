description:    "In 2001, with an amendment to the Turkish Electricity Market Act, the government started to lease the ‘usage rights’ of rivers for 49 years to private companies for the sole purpose of producing electricity. These hydropower plants - abbreviated as ‘HES’ in Turkish - allow the companies to suck the life out of even the smallest rivers."
